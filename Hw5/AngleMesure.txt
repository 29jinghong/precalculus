Angle Measures in Precalculus
Angles can be measured in degrees or radians.

1. Degrees vs. Radians
Degrees: A full circle is 360°.
Radians: A full circle is 2π radians.
The conversion formulas are:

1∘= 𝜋/180 radians

1 radian = 180/𝜋

2. Converting Between Degrees and Radians
Example 1: Convert 45∘ to radians

45∘ × 𝜋/180 = 𝜋/4 radians

Example 2: Convert 5𝜋/6 radians to degrees

5𝜋/6 × 180/𝜋 =150∘

3. Coterminal Angles
Coterminal angles share the same terminal side and can be found by adding or subtracting 360∘ (or 2π radians).

Example: Find a positive and negative coterminal angle for 60∘

Positive:
60∘ + 360∘ = 420∘

Negative:
60∘ − 360∘ = −300∘

4. Complementary and Supplementary Angles
Complementary: Two angles that sum to 90∘ (or 𝜋/2 radians).
Supplementary: Two angles that sum to 180∘(or π radians).
