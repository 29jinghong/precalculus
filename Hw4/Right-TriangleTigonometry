Arc Length Example
The formula for arc length (s) of a circle is:

s=rθ
where:
s = arc length

r = radius of the circle

θ = central angle in radians

Example Problem:
A circle has a radius of 10 cm, and the central angle is 𝜋/3 radians. Find the arc length.

Solution
Using the formula:
s=rθ
𝑠 = 10 × 𝜋/3

𝑠 = 10𝜋/3

So, the arc length is 10𝜋/3 cm, or approximately 10.47 cm.
